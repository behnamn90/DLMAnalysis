# DLMAnalysis
Analysis tools for domain-level model (DLM) simulations. This is an accompanying package for the main DLM code, which is written in C++:<br>
https://github.com/behnamn90/DLM

Together, they are used to produce all the results in my doctoral thesis:<br>

## Functionalities:
- Convert cadnano files (https://cadnano.org/) to input files used in DLM simulations.
- Run batch DLM simulations (requires excecutable from C++ code).
- Analyse and visualise batch simulation results; these are large datasets that describe DNA origami trajectories.

## Usage:
See the `demo.ipynb` for some basic usage. Note that the project is designed to run on computer clusters and produces large datasets. Some pre-analysed data is included here to demonstrate the usage.
